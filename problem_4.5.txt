Modify the FractionMath program(Programming project 4, chapter 3)
so it performs a partial validation. If either fraction does
not contain exactly one slash, have the program prompt the user
to re-enter the fraction. The program will repeat the prompt
as often as necessary until the user enters a string containing
one slash.
